To do:
- Let udtGetIdMagicNumber and udtGetUDTMagicNumber use a single udtGameInfo structure
	that contains the protocol, mod and mod version
	instead of just the protocol and mod as 2 separate variables
	this might become necessary for mods that change(d) key stuff over time
- Rate-limit warning messages to avoid visual spam and UI slow-downs
	- assign types and save last timestamp per type
	- if same warning type happens twice in X ms, don't invoke the callback
- Improve look_up_tables.cpp further
	- rethink to account for mods better?
	- remove the 2 extra table data declarations everywhere
		- allocate everything with a single big table instead
		- simply assert on the table size being large enough at init and we're good
	- each entry in table arrays should be (pointer, length, protocol list)
		- we can validate that all entries have the expected -1 key value to end the table
			and keep the tables nice and readable
			(could even have all that data inlined from now on)
		- protocol list: udtProtocol::* udtProtocolList::End
			where udtProtocolList::End is udtProtocol::Count or higher (avoid 0 due to 0-init)
	- protocol list: fixed-size array u32 Protocols[udtProtocol::Count + 1]
	- #define for the common protocol lists: Q3, QL, Quake, RTCW, ET, Wolfenstein, ...
- Player position smoothing for "laggy" demos
- DLL: Better mid-air detection heuristics?
- DLL: Give plug-ins the ability to tell when their job is done so that parsing can be stopped early
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "max. time after spawn" option to detect sequences of spawnfrags
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "all kills vs the same player" option?
- Auto-rename functionality (quicker but less correct version: read the first game-state message only)
- Merger: Find a way to solve the "item problem"
- Merger: Find a way to deal with the "player entities event sequence problem"
- Time shifter: Finer granularity level? Give the offset in milliseconds or floating-point snapshot count?
- Track overtime start/end times to be able to translate all match times to server times
- More reliable overtime detection?
- Enemy Territory support? (protocols 82, 83, 84)
- DeFRaG support?
- Restart demo parsing when sv_pure is 0 and there's a mismatch between protocol and server engine versions
